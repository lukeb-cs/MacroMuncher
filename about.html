            <p>MacroMuncher is a website built to make tracking calories and improving overall health easy. Without
                advertisements, subscriptions, or data collection, count your calories and accomplish your fitness
                goals in just a couple minutes each day. Data from the app is stored locally in your browser which means
                that no one will be using this site to track your personal preferences or other information. This
                project is entirely open-source and can be found on my public GitHub account.
                Freely explore an easy health solution with MacroMuncher! Understand,
                however, that this site is not a substitute for real medical advice from real doctors; it's a passion
                project made by a health-focused computer science student.</p>

                <p>My name is Luke Brenningmeyer, and I'm the creator of MacroMuncher. At the moment, I'm pursuing a
                    Computer Science Bachelor's Degree from James Madison University alongside both a robotics and
                    honors interdisciplinary studies minor. This project, made with the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML
                    languages, serves to showcase my understanding of online web development. This website also
                    satisfies a couple personal interests of mine: nutrition and health. Using many calorie tracking
                    websites and applications in the past myself, I'm not satisfied with the average individual's
                    accessability to health resources. Tracking your caloric or macro-nutrient intake should be easy
                    for the average person.</p>
